# Sea Cleaner
Tech test solution for marshmallow backend engineer test.


#### Running
To run the program, use the following command:
`./gradlew bootRun`

The progress bar might not reach 100%. If this happens you can look for the following log line and know that the
app is running:
```2020-04-11 13:36:34.852  INFO 7376 --- [           main] c.mcerlean.techtest.TechtestApplication  : Started TechtestApplication in 1.418 seconds (JVM running for 1.724)```


#### Notes

- Requires Java 11
- There is only one endpoint - "/"
- No unit tests due to time constraints. Some of the commands I used for testing
can be found in commands.txt. These are not scripted and are intended to be run individually.
 A brief description of expected output is included with each command.
